[The Rise of Worse is Better By Richard P. Gabriel](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html)

#Why I Found This Interesting
I found this article interesting because it reminded me about what we learned in class. I looked up the "New Jersey Style" that the article refers to and found that this style is similar to our intro on Software Engineering.
The style says that worse is better and that simplicity and ease of use are more beneficial than functionality. This reminded me of what the Professor taught us: bespoke development is the antithesis of the modern-day agile developer.
We can not make everyone happy with our product and its best to apply a consistent strategy to our projects than custom tailoring them.
While meeting client expectations is important, it is best to prioritize saving time and cost while still delivering an acceptable product.
